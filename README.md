# Executive Summary  
TalentStage is a full-featured freelance marketplace for creative and technical talent.  Freelancers create rich portfolio profiles (bio, skills, rate, portfolio items) and browse/submit proposals on client projects.  Clients post projects (fixed or hourly), receive bids, shortlist and hire freelancers, set up milestone payments, and review deliverables.  The platform incorporates AI-driven matching (rank freelancers by skills/portfolio/rating), automated proposal evaluation (score bids on relevance and value), skill verification tests, and a project-scoping assistant.  Community features include a public forum/feed, weekly skill challenges, and a mentorship directory.  Payment flows use an escrow/milestone system and simulate a 10% platform commission.  We will deliver a developer-ready blueprint: feature maps, API specs, data models, UI screens, security, DevOps plan, tests, and roadmaps.  

# Problem Statement & Scope  
TalentStage must implement all features listed in the project description.  Key requirements include: freelancer profile and portfolio management; project posting, bidding, and contracts; milestone payments and commission tracking; AI-powered matching and proposal scoring; skill verification badges; project brief generation; a community feed with challenges; mentorship sessions; single unified account (freelancer/client); identity verification; profile completeness scoring; simulated payments/escrow; and a paid “Pro” subscription.  We assume no contradictory constraints beyond the statement; unspecified details (e.g. exact UI design) will follow common marketplace patterns or noted assumptions.  All features will map to concrete API endpoints, data models, UI components, and acceptance tests.

_Citation examples:_ Upwork’s help and pricing docs describe profile and portfolio fields【38†L65-L73】【48†L471-L478】; AI components follow recent research【74†L13-L16】【20†L159-L168】. All responses use JSON.  Error codes include 400 for bad input, 401 for auth, 500 for server errors.

# AI/ML Components  

- **Freelancer Matching Model:** Input = project details (skills, description), candidate pool data (skills, portfolio vector, ratings). Output = ranked list of top freelancers.  We will train/use a model similar to Upwork’s two-stage approach【20†L159-L168】 (e.g. BM25 initial recall + gradient boosted re-rank with features: text match, skill overlap, avg rating).  Use historical project-bid data to train.  *Metrics:* Precision@5 (correct hire in top5).  *Latency:* <2s per query (requirements: real-time shortlist).  *Privacy:* Use only public profile data.  *Fallback:* If AI fails, default to simple skill+rate filter.  

- **Proposal Scoring Model:** Input = proposal text + freelancer profile vs project text. Output = relevance/quality score. Use a small NLP model (fine-tuned BERT) to predict a score based on Upwork’s description【74†L13-L16】.  *Training data:* Past proposals labeled by hire/outcome.  *Metrics:* Correlation with hiring outcome.  *Latency:* 1s.  *Fallback:* if unavailable, show proposals unranked.  

- **Portfolio Reviewer:** Input = portfolio item texts + tags. Output = suggestions (short descriptions etc).  Could use GPT-4 for feedback.  *Privacy:* Only on user request.  

- **Skill Test Generation:** Input = skill name.  Use OpenAI/GPT API or custom LLM to generate 10 MCQs and one coding prompt per skill.  *Evaluation:* BLEU or manual review.  *Latency:* ~5s.  *Fallback:* static question pool.  

- **Project Brief Generator:** Input = free-text client need.  Use LLM (e.g. GPT-4) to output structured deliverables, timeline, budget.  *Metrics:* Human evaluator score.  *Fallback:* Manual input only if AI off.  

# UX/UI Inventory  

- **Screens:** 
  - **Signup/Login Flow:** Sign up with email/password, select role (Freelancer/Client/Both). *Microcopy:* “Get started on TalentStage – find projects or talent.”  
  - **Profile Page (Freelancer):** Shows photo, title, bio, rate, skills, badges, portfolio gallery. “Complete your profile (80% done)” meter. *Accessible:* images have alt text, forms labeled.  
  - **Edit Profile:** Form sections: Basic Info, Skills, Education, Portfolio, Photo. Tooltip for linked accounts (LinkedIn).  
  - **Portfolio Page:** Thumbnails of projects. “Add New Project” button opens a form (title, desc, tools, media upload).  
  - **Project Listing:** Search bar + filters (skills, budget). List view showing title, budget, snippet. Each has a “View Details” button.  
  - **Post Project Wizard:** Step 1: Basic info (title, desc), Step 2: Skills/tags, Step 3: Budget and deadline, Step 4: Preview. “Use AI to help scope” button.  
  - **Project Details (Client):** Shows all bids. Each proposal item shows freelancer avatar, bid amount, timeline, cover text, and AI score badge. Buttons “Shortlist” and “Hire”.  
  - **Browse Freelancers (AI Match):** When posting, a “Recommended Freelancers” list appears with profile snippets and match % (via AI).  
  - **Proposal Form:** For freelancers, form with bid amount, timeline, and cover letter textbox (WYSIWYG). “Submit Proposal” button.  
  - **Contract Workspace:** Messages pane (chat), files pane (uploads), milestones list with statuses, “Submit Work” button, and “Approve Payment” for clients.  
  - **Payments Tab:** Shows earnings breakdown (total earned, pending, fees) and calendar of withdrawals.  
  - **Community Feed:** Infinite scroll of posts. Each post has “like/comment” and category tags. “Create Post” button opens text editor.  
  - **Challenge Page:** List of weekly challenges, “Submit Entry” form. “Leaderboard” for featured winners.  
  - **Mentorship Directory:** List of mentors with short bios and rate. “Book Session” opens calendar.  

_All screens must be responsive and WCAG-compliant (alt text, keyboard nav, contrast).  Example microcopy:_  
- Login error: “Incorrect email or password.”  
- Project post button: “Post Project – let freelancers find you.”  
- Withdraw funds: “Enter amount to withdraw (min $50).”  

# Security & Compliance  

- **Auth:** All API calls (except signup/login) require JWT bearer token. Enforce HTTPS. Store passwords hashed (bcrypt). Use OWASP best practices.  
- **Identity Verification:** Clients/freelancers upload ID (student card/LinkedIn URL). Handle PII securely (encrypted storage, limited staff access). After verification, mark user.  
- **Payment Security:** We simulate escrow; no real payments. Still, handle simulated credit card numbers in sandbox (no storage). Display commission clearly.  
- **Data Privacy:** Only show public portfolio data. PII (email, IDs) not exposed. Comply with GDPR/CCPA: allow data export/deletion, cookie consent, privacy policy link.  
- **Rate Limiting:** API: 60 req/min per user. Additional limits on AI endpoints to protect API keys.  
- **XSS/CSRF:** Use CSRF tokens for forms, sanitize user input on posts.  
- **Moderation:** Community posts are moderated (flagging, admin removal). User trust badges (like Verified) to reduce fraud.  

# DevOps & Infrastructure  

- **Architecture:** Microservices or modular monolith. Suggested services: `auth-service`, `user-service`, `project-service`, `contract-service`, `payment-service`, `community-service`, `ai-service`. Use PostgreSQL for core DB, Elasticsearch for search (projects/freelancers), Redis for caching (session, rate-limit). AI/ML components on GPU instance or API cloud. Host on AWS or GCP.  
- **Scalability:** Design stateless API; horizontal scale with load balancer. Store static media on S3/Cloud.  
- **Monitoring:** Use Prometheus+Grafana for system metrics, logs sent to Elastic or Splunk. Set alerts on error rate >1% or latency spikes.  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or Jenkins. Automated tests on PR. Dockerize each service. Deploy to Kubernetes or ECS with blue-green releases.  
- **Cost Estimate:** (Monthly) Low: ~$5K (small AWS), Med: $15K (moderate traffic), High: $50K+ (global scale). Assume AWS t3.medium instances, managed DB, occasional GPUs for AI.  
- **Privacy:** Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. AI models use public data only (no user API logs retained).  

# Testing Plan  

- **Unit Tests:** For each API endpoint and service function. E.g. test portfolio item creation, proposal submission.  
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate full flows: signup→create profile→post project→submit proposal→contract→milestone. Verify data consistency.  
- **E2E Tests:** Use Selenium/Cypress on UI flows: signing up as freelancer, filling profile, bidding; client posting project and hiring.  
- **Load Tests:** Simulate 1000 concurrent users on APIs (k6 or JMeter). Ensure response <500ms on read APIs.  
- **Security Tests:** Penetration tests for OWASP Top 10; automated scanning (Snyk/OWASP ZAP).  
- **AI Model Validation:** For matching, measure if actual hired freelancer appears in top-5 (target >80%). For proposal scoring, AUC or accuracy vs human label. Retest after each model update.  
- **Sample Test Scenarios:**  
  1. **Proposal Ranking:** Post a project requiring “React”. Submit 3 proposals: one with relevant skills, one missing skills, one irrelevant. AI score should rank the relevant proposal highest【74†L13-L16】.  
  2. **Escrow Flow:** Client posts fixed project, funds $200 into escrow, freelancer delivers milestone. On approval, $180 goes to freelancer (10% fee). Check commission shown.  
  3. **Skill Test:** Freelancer claims “Python” skill, takes test; fails (score <70%) => no badge; retake yields pass and “Verified Python Developer” badge appears.  
  4. **Profile Completeness:** New freelancer logs in: completeness shows 40%. After adding bio, skills, and a portfolio item, completeness goes to 100%.  
  5. **AI Matching:** Client posts AI-related job. System returns top-5 freelancers all with AI/ML skills (via Elasticsearch and ML).  
  6. **Community Moderation:** User posts spam/ad. Moderator tool flags it or it is auto-blocked (keyword filter).  
  7. **Payment Withdrawal:** Freelancer with $500 balance requests $600 -> error. Requests $100 -> success, pending 2 days.  
  8. **Mentorship Booking:** User books a session; both mentor and mentee receive calendar invites and an entry in “MentorshipSession”.  

_Pass criteria:_ All flows work end-to-end, with correct data, no unhandled errors, and UI matches wireframes.

**Appendix (Examples):**  
- *SQL Query:* Find top-rated freelancers for “React”:  
```sql
SELECT u.name, AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating 
FROM User u JOIN Review r ON u.id=r.freelancer_id 
JOIN UserSkill us ON u.id=us.user_id JOIN Skill s ON us.skill_id=s.id 
WHERE s.name='React' 
GROUP BY u.id 
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```  
- *UI Copy (Signup):* “Join TalentStage – Sign up as Freelancer or Client.”  *(Proposal Submission):* “Describe your bid. Add details about your timeline and value.”  *(Escrow Release):* “Release payment and close milestone?”  –
